# LSTF_Scheduling_Implementation
LSTF (Longest Service Time First) is a scheduling algorithm that prioritizes tasks with the longest execution time first. It can lead to long waiting times for shorter tasks and is generally inefficient for interactive systems but may be useful when longer jobs need priority.
